### Instructions



### Process

In the first stage, I planned how the game was going to look, this step required understanding how the original game worked precisely, what technologies could be used to build the game and the class structure of the game.

In the second stage, I set my goals to MVP to make sure that the technology I chose was suitable for building the game.

At the development stage I developed the following order:
1. Set the UI of the game
2. Development of spaceship
3. Develop the possibility to shoot by spaceship
4. Develop the asteroids (including their explosion into different parts and their creation in a different way).
5. Develop the possibility to score, level and lives.
6. Developing the saucer
7. Add sound and improve UI
